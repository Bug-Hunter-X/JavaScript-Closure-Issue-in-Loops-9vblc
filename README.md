This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to closures within loops.  The code in `bug.js` shows a `for` loop using `setTimeout`.  Because of JavaScript's closure behavior, the loop completes before the `setTimeout` functions execute, resulting in the unexpected output of ten 10s. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to resolve the issue using an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) or `let` to create a new scope for each iteration.
